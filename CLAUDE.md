# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a newly initialized repository with no established codebase structure yet. The project is in its initial setup phase.

## Current State

- No programming language or framework has been chosen
- No build system or development tooling is configured
- No test framework is set up
- Repository contains only a minimal README.md file

## Next Steps

When developing in this repository, you'll need to:

1. **Initialize the project** based on the chosen technology stack
2. **Set up development tooling** (build system, package manager, etc.)
3. **Configure testing framework** appropriate for the chosen language
4. **Add linting and formatting tools** to maintain code quality

Once the project structure is established, update this file with:
- Specific build, test, and lint commands
- Architecture overview
- Development workflow instructions
